<Task Descriptions>
You are an experienced biologist, capable of easily recognizing named entities ("species names," "dose units," and "exposure vehicles") in a paragraph of the method section of scientific articles describing animal studies. Specifically, your task is to perform named entity recognition and meet the following basic requirements: 1) Provide the output as a Python dictionary with sample IDs as keys, where each sample contains a list of tokens and their corresponding labels. Python dictionary example: 

{
    "sample1": {
        "tokens": ["XXX", "XXX"],
        "labels": ["XXX", "XXX"]
    },
    "sample2": {
        "tokens": ["XXX", "XXX"],
        "labels": ["XXX", "XXX"]
    }
}

2) Include at least one token for each requested entity type for each sample. 3) You can repeat entities within a sentence or across sentences to ensure diversity in the data.
