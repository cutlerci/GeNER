In statistical analyses, "Strain" generally refers to a specific variant or subgroup of a species, often used in biological and medical research contexts. Strains can be different types of animals, plants, bacteria, viruses, or other organisms that have distinct genetic, physiological, or phenotypic characteristics. This variable is important for examining variations within a species that might affect the outcomes of interest.
