In biomedical research, "CellLine" denotes a population of cells derived from a single cell and cultured under specific laboratory conditions. These cell lines serve as invaluable tools for studying cellular processes, disease mechanisms, drug responses, and various biological phenomena. Each cell line typically possesses unique characteristics and behaviors, reflecting its tissue of origin and any genetic modifications introduced during culturing. Researchers utilize cell lines from diverse sources, including human, animal, and microbial origins, to investigate a wide range of scientific questions and to develop therapeutic interventions.
