In biological and ecological studies, "Species" refers to a fundamental unit of classification in the taxonomic hierarchy. It represents a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring under natural conditions. Each species typically exhibits distinct morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics, contributing to its unique identity within an ecosystem. Within the context of scientific research involving animal subjects, "Species" denotes the specific type or category of organisms under investigation, encompassing a variety of taxa such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates.
