In statistical analyses, "GroupName" refers to distinct categories or levels within a dataset that are compared to assess differences or effects. These groupings typically represent experimental conditions, treatment regimens, or other factors of interest being investigated. Assigning observations to appropriate group names allows researchers to conduct comparative evaluations and infer relationships or associations between variables. Group names play a crucial role in hypothesis testing, where researchers aim to determine whether observed differences between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance.
